## Description
The E-commerce Back End project is about creating the back end for an e-commerce site. This involves configuring an Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation
To get started, clone the starter code from the repository. Then, install the required npm packages: MySQL2, Sequelize, dotenv and Express.js. You'll also need to create and seed your MySQL database using the provided schema and seeds files.

## Usage
- Configure environment variables for your database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password.
- Use the schema.sql file in the db folder to create your database using MySQL shell commands.
- Run npm run seed to seed data to your database.
- Start the application by running npm start.
- Use API endpoints in a platform like Insomnia Core to view, create, update and delete data.
